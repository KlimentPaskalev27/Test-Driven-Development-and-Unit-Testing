# Test-Driven Development and Unit Testing in JavaScript, Python and C++
In this repo, I will be following the main concepts of Test-Driven Development and reiterate over unit tests in three different programming languages: JavaScript, Python and C++. This aims to provide some good practice into unit testing in those languages and serve me as some insight as to why TDD is preferred in some cases.

## The Three Laws of Test-Driven Development:
- You may not write production code unless you’re written a failing unit test.
- You may not write more of a unit test than it is sufficient to fail.
- You may not write more production code than is sufficient to make the failing unit test pass.

Ideally, the cycle to write a test, fail it, write production code and pass the test should take around 2 minutes.
